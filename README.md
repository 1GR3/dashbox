# dashbox


**A boxed dashboard for new generations of MacOS.**

Dashboard was introduced with Mac OS X 10.4, disabeld by default from OS X 10.10 Yosemite and finally removed in macOS 10.15 Catalina. For 11+ years it was a main app to run simple applications called widgets which included world clock, calcualtor, dictionary and all sort fo converters. These might come handy on daly basis to everyone who works on international level.

**dashbox** is an attempt to preserve this functionality for the post-mojave versions of MacOS.
